Supports jQuery, MooTools and Prototype.  For HTML5 browsers this means that you can modify the URL directly, without needing to use hashes anymore. For HTML4 browsers it will revert back to using the old onhashchange functionality.",

Started to categorize old balupton's issues.\n\n\n### History\n[See the `HISTORY.md` file for a detailed list of features, changes, solved issues and bugs](https://github.com/browserstate/history.js/blob/master/HISTORY.md#files)\n\n\n### Involve\nPlease create an issue if something doesn't work or if there is a browser specific bug. I'll try to fix it as soon as possible. Please send me your Pull requests if you have a nice solution! I'm also going to review old issues in balupton's repository and try to solve them too.\n\n\n## Aims\n\n- Follow the [HTML5 History API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/Manipulating_the_browser_history) as much as possible\n- Provide a cross-compatible experience for all HTML5 Browsers (they all implement the HTML5 History API a little bit differently causing different behaviours and sometimes bugs - History.js fixes this ensuring the experience is as expected / the same / great throughout the HTML5 browsers)\n- Provide a backwards-compatible experience for all HTML4 Browsers using a hash-fallback (including continued support for the HTML5 History API's `data`, `title`, `pushState` and `replaceState`) with the option to [remove HTML4 support if it is not right for your application](https://github.com/browserstate/history.js/wiki/Intelligent-State-Handling)\n- Provide a forwards-compatible experience for HTML4 States to HTML5 States (so if a hash-fallbacked url is accessed by a HTML5 browser it is naturally transformed into its non-hashed url equivalent)\n- Provide support for as many javascript frameworks as possible via adapters; especially [Dojo](http://dojotoolkit.org/), [ExtJS](http://www.sencha.com/), [jQuery](http://jquery.com/), [MooTools](http://mootools.net/), [Right.js](http://rightjs.org/) and [Zepto](http://zeptojs.com/).\n\n\n## Quick Install\n\n### Via Ajaxify Script\nTo ajaxify your entire website with the HTML5 History API, History.js and jQuery the [Ajaxify script](https://github.com/browserstate/ajaxify) is all you need. It's that easy.\n\n### Via Ajaxify Extension\nIf you don't have access to your server, or just want to try out the Ajaxify script first, you can install the [History.js It! Google Chrome Extension](https://github.com/browserstate/historyjsit.crx) to try out History.js via Ajaxify on select websites without actually installing History.js/Ajaxify on your server.\n\n### Via Ruby On Rails Gem\nIf you are using Rails, then the easiest way for you to try History.js would be to use [Wiselinks](https://github.com/igor-alexandrov/wiselinks) gem. Wiselinks integrates  into Rails application and allows you to start using History.js with three lines of code.\n\n\n## Direct Install\n\n### Working with History.js directly\n\n``` javascript\n(function(window,undefined){\n\n\t// Bind to StateChange Event\n\tHistory.Adapter.bind(window,'statechange',function(){ // Note: We are using statechange instead of popstate\n\t\tvar State = History.getState(); // Note: We are using History.getState() instead of event.state\n\t});\n\n\t// Change our States\n\tHistory.pushState({state:1}, \"State 1\", \"?state=1\"); // logs {state:1}, \"State 1\", \"?state=1\"\n\tHistory.pushState({state:2}, \"State 2\", \"?state=2\"); // logs {state:2}, \"State 2\", \"?state=2\"\n\tHistory.replaceState({state:3}, \"State 3\", \"?state=3\"); // logs {state:3}, \"State 3\", \"?state=3\"\n\tHistory.pushState(null, null, \"?state=4\"); // logs {}, '', \"?state=4\"\n\tHistory.back(); // logs {state:3}, \"State 3\", \"?state=3\"\n\tHistory.back(); // logs {state:1}, \"State 1\", \"?state=1\"\n\tHistory.back(); // logs {}, \"Home Page\", \"?\"\n\tHistory.go(2); // logs {state:3}, \"State 3\", \"?state=3\"\n\n})(window);\n```\n\n\n### How would the above operations look in a HTML5 Browser?\n\n1. www.mysite.com\n1. www.mysite.com/?state=1\n1. www.mysite.com/?state=2\n1. www.mysite.com/?state=3\n1. www.mysite.com/?state=4\n1. www.mysite.com/?state=3\n1. www.mysite.com/?state=1\n1. www.mysite.com\n1. www.mysite.com/?state=3\n\n> Note: These urls also work in HTML4 browsers and Search Engines. So no need for the hashbang (`#!`) fragment-identifier that google [\"recommends\"](https://github.com/browserstate/history.js/wiki/Intelligent-State-Handling).\n\n\n### How would they look in a HTML4 Browser?\n\n1. www.mysite.com\n1. www.mysite.com/#?state=1&_suid=1\n1. www.mysite.com/#?state=2&_suid=2\n1. www.mysite.com/#?state=3&_suid=3\n1. www.mysite.com/#?state=4\n1. www.mysite.com/#?state=3&_suid=3\n1. www.mysite.com/#?state=1&_suid=1\n1. www.mysite.com\n1. www.mysite.com/#?state=3&_suid=3\n\n> Note 1: These urls also work in HTML5 browsers - we use `replaceState` to transform these HTML4 states into their HTML5 equivalents so the user won't even notice :-)\n>\n> Note 2: These urls will be automatically url-encoded in IE6 to prevent certain browser-specific bugs.\n>\n> Note 3: Support for HTML4 browsers (this hash fallback) is optional [- why supporting HTML4 browsers could be either good or bad based on my app's use cases](https://github.com/browserstate/history.js/wiki/Intelligent-State-Handling)\n\n\n### What's the deal with the SUIDs used in the HTML4 States?\n\n- SUIDs (State Unique Identifiers) are used when we utilise a `title` and/or `data` in our state. Adding a SUID allows us to associate particular states with data and titles while keeping the urls as simple as possible (don't worry it's all tested, working and a lot smarter than I'm making it out to be).\n- If you aren't utilising `title` or `data` then we don't even include a SUID (as there is no need for it) - as seen by State 4 above :-)\n- We also shrink the urls to make sure that the smallest url will be used. For instance we will adjust `http://www.mysite.com/#http://www.mysite.com/projects/History.js` to become `http://www.mysite.com/#/projects/History.js` automatically. (again tested, working, and smarter).\n- It works with domains, subdomains, subdirectories, whatever - doesn't matter where you put it. It's smart.\n- Safari 5 will also have a SUID appended to the URL, it is entirely transparent but just a visible side-effect. It is required to fix a bug with Safari 5.\n\n\n### Is there a working demo?\n\n- Sure is, give it a download and navigate to the demo directory in your browser :-)\n- If you are after something a bit more adventurous than a end-user demo, open up the tests directory in your browser and editor - it'll rock your world and show all the vast use cases that History.js supports.\n\n\n## Download & Installation\n\n- Download History.js and upload it to your webserver. Download links: [tar.gz](https://github.com/browserstate/history.js/tarball/master) or [zip](https://github.com/browserstate/history.js/zipball/master)\n\n- Include History.js\n\n\t- For [Dojo](http://dojotoolkit.org/) v1.8+\n\n\t\t``` html\n\t\t<script src=\"http://www.yourwebsite.com/history.js/scripts/bundled/html4+html5/dojo.history.js\"></script>\n\t\t```\n\t\n\t- For [ExtJs](http://www.sencha.com/) v1.8+\n\n\t\t``` html\n\t\t<script src=\"http://www.yourwebsite.com/history.js/scripts/bundled/html4+html5/extjs.history.js\"></script>\n\t\t```\n\t\n\t- For [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) v1.3+\n\n\t\t``` html\n\t\t<script src=\"http://www.yourwebsite.com/history.js/scripts/bundled/html4+html5/jquery.history.js\"></script>\n\t\t```\n\n\t- For [Mootools](http://mootools.net/) v1.3+\n\n\t\t``` html\n\t\t<script src=\"http://www.yourwebsite.com/history.js/scripts/bundled/html4+html5/mootools.history.js\"></script>\n\t\t```\n\n\t- For [Right.js](http://rightjs.org/) v2.2+\n\n\t\t``` html\n\t\t<script src=\"http://www.yourwebsite.com/history.js/scripts/bundled/html4+html5/right.history.js\"></script>\n\t\t```\n\n\t- For [Zepto](http://zeptojs.com/) v0.5+\n\n\t\t``` html\n\t\t<script src=\"http://www.yourwebsite.com/history.js/scripts/bundled/html4+html5/zepto.history.js\"></script>\n\t\t```\n\n\t- For everything else\n\n\t\t``` html\n\t\t<script src=\"http://www.yourwebsite.com/history.js/scripts/bundled/html4+html5/native.history.js\"></script>\n\t\t```\n\n> Note: If you want to only support HTML5 Browsers and not HTML4 Browsers (so no hash fallback support) then just change the `/html4+html5/` part in the urls to just `/html5/`. See [Why supporting HTML4 browsers could be either good or bad based on my app's use cases](https://github.com/browserstate/history.js/wiki/Intelligent-State-Handling)\n\n\n## Get Updates\n\n- For Commit RSS/Atom Updates:\n\t- You can subscribe via the [GitHub Commit Atom Feed](http://feeds.feedburner.com/historyjs)\n- For GitHub News Feed Updates:\n\t- You can click the \"watch\" button up the top right of History.js's [GitHub Project Page](https://github.com/browserstate/history.js)\n\n\n## Get Support\n\n- History.js is maintained by people like you.

there is nothing we can do about this\n- Mercury iOS fails to apply url changes (hashes and HTML5 History API states) - there is nothing we can do about this\n\n\n## Notes on Compatibility\n\n- History.js **solves** the following browser bugs:\n\t- HTML5 Browsers\n\t\t- Chrome 8 sometimes does not contain the correct state data when traversing back to the initial state\n\t\t- Safari 5, Safari iOS 4 and Firefox 3 and 4 do not fire the `onhashchange` event when the page is loaded with a hash\n\t\t- Safari 5 and Safari iOS 4 do not fire the `onpopstate` event when the hash has changed unlike the other browsers\n\t\t- Safari 5 and Safari iOS 4 fail to return to the correct state once a hash is replaced by a `replaceState` call / [bug report](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=56249)\n\t\t- Safari 5 and Safari iOS 4 sometimes fail to apply the state change under busy conditions / [bug report](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=42940)\n\t\t- Google Chrome 8,9,10 and Firefox 4 prior to the RC will always fire `onpopstate` once the page has loaded / [change recommendation](http://hacks.mozilla.org/2011/03/history-api-changes-in-firefox-4/)\n\t\t- Safari iOS 4.0, 4.1, 4.2 have a working HTML5 History API - although the actual back buttons of the browsers do not work, therefore we treat them as HTML4 browsers\n\t\t- None of the HTML5 browsers actually utilise the `title` argument to the `pushState` and `replaceState` calls\n\t- HTML4 Browsers\n\t\t- Old browsers like MSIE 6,7 and Firefox 2 do not have a `onhashchange` event\n\t\t- MSIE 6 and 7 sometimes do not apply a hash even it was told to (requiring a second call to the apply function)\n\t\t- Non-Opera HTML4 browsers sometimes do not apply the hash when the hash is not `urlencoded`\n\t- All Browsers\n\t\t- State data and titles do not persist once the site is left and then returned (includes page refreshes)\n\t\t- State titles are never applied to the `document.title`\n- ReplaceState functionality is emulated in HTML4 browsers by discarding the replaced state, so when the discarded state is accessed it is skipped using the appropriate `History.back()` / `History.forward()` call\n- Data persistance and synchronisation works like so: Every second or so, the SUIDs and URLs of the states will synchronise between the store and the local session. When a new session opens a familiar state (via the SUID or the URL) and it is not found locally then it will attempt to load the last known stored state with that information.\n- URLs will be unescaped to the maximum, so for instance the URL `?key=a%20b%252c` will become `?key=a b c`. This is to ensure consistency between browser url encodings.\n- Changing the hash of the page causes `onpopstate` to fire (this is expected/standard functionality). To ensure correct compatibility between HTML5 and HTML4 browsers the following events have been created:\n\t- `window.onstatechange`: this is the same as the `onpopstate` event except it does not fire for traditional anchors\n\t- `window.onanchorchange`: this is the same as the `onhashchange` event except it does not fire for states\n\n\n\n## License\n\nLicensed under the [New BSD License](http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause)\n<br/>Copyright &copy;  2014+ [Bevry Pty Ltd](http://bevry.me) <us@bevry.me>\n<br/>Copyright &copy;  2011-2013 [Benjamin Arthur Lupton](http://balupton.com) <b@lupton.cc>\n\nFor support see the [Getting Support](#get-support) section.\n",
